It’s Read Across America Week 2025—a time dedicated to promoting reading among students. As a lifelong learner, I believe it’s essential to continue reading throughout your career. Reading is one of the best ways to expand your knowledge, refine your skills, and improve yourself.

Here’s a list of books that have had the biggest impact on my career, grouped by category.

## **Software Development and Craftsmanship**

Being a self-taught developer, I sought out resources to ensure I wasn’t just writing spaghetti code that worked but was difficult to maintain. These books have been invaluable in that journey.

### **Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship** – _Robert C. Martin_

A must-read for any software developer, this book dives deep into writing maintainable, readable, and efficient code. Uncle Bob’s principles on naming, functions, and code structure have reshaped how I approach development.

### **The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers** – _Robert C. Martin_

While _Clean Code_ focuses on writing good code, _The Clean Coder_ emphasizes professionalism in software development. It covers topics such as learning to say “no” when necessary, managing time effectively, and handling deadlines with integrity. Many new developers think programming is just about writing code, but soft skills are equally important.

A fantastic resource for self-taught developers and anyone experiencing imposter syndrome in the industry. It covers computer science fundamentals—from algorithms to encryption—in an accessible and engaging way. Many self-taught developers feel imposter syndrome, yet some of the best engineers I’ve worked with are self-taught. I believe it’s because they genuinely love technology, rather than just picking a degree for job security.

### **The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win** – _Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford_

Told as a novel, this book introduces DevOps principles and highlights the importance of collaboration in IT organizations. It’s surprising how many software companies still don’t follow even the most basic DevOps practices.
